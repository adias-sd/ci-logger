Built with ❤️ using React Router.

## TODOs

1. Make the error navigation button cycle through errors instead of going to the first one,
2. Improve the [Monarch](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/monarch.html) file for this specific logs,
3. Consider bringing the folder view to the file view for better access (sacrifices field of view though and does not allow me to show off router knowledge),
4. Zoom feature for file viewer (you can zoom your browser but not ideal).
